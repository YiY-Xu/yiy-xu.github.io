<h1>Interview Questions</h1>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<h3>1. Merge Time Interval</h3>
<p>Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals. Let the intervals be represented as pairs of integers for simplicity.<br />For example, let the given set of intervals be {{1,3}, {2,4}, {5,7}, {6,8} }. The intervals {1,3} and {2,4} overlap with each other, so they should be merged and become {1, 4}. Similarly {5, 7} and {6, 8} should be merged and become {5, 8}</p>
<h3>2. Implement Convolve Operation</h3>
<p>Given an M x N matrix as a source and a X x Y matrix as a sliding window, please implement a convolve operation. If the sliding window exceeds the edge of the source, please just calculate the overlap part.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Implement Consumer and Producer</h3>
<p>Please implement a consumer and producer model. You should firstly initiate three queues with random lengths. And then, you should create a producer thread that continuously creates items and put them into the shortest queue (randomly pick one if there are multiple shortest ones). You should create three consumers which only consumes its own queue. Please pay attention to access the shared resource in a synchronized way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Find Number of Islands</h3>
<p>Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an island. A connection is defined when a one at position[i][j], there is another one at any of the cells within a 3x3 matrix with the current one at the center.</p>
<h2>Data Structure</h2>
<p>Please design a data structure to describe a person. A person has his/her own attributes such as name, age, gender. A person can have multiple abilities. These abilities can be acquired. Furthermore, an ability can only be acquired when its predefined prerequisite ability is acquired. An ability is described by several attributes too. For instance, run, as an ability, has speed as its attribute to describe the level of ability. The ability can be compared between persons. You don't need to implement any method, but just design the data structure that you think fits the requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Design Pattern</h2>
<h3>1. Implement Factory Design Pattern</h3>
<p>Please implement a factory design pattern. You should create classes represent apple devices (MBP, IPHONE, IPAD). Then you should create a factory class that has a get_instance method. This method accepts the name of the device as a parameter and returns the corresponding device instances.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Implement Singleton Design Pattern</h3>
<p>Please implement a singleton design pattern. Your class should return the only instance of the class if it has been created or create one if it hasn't.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
<p>Please create a static Html file with the needed styles to show the below table.&nbsp;</p>
